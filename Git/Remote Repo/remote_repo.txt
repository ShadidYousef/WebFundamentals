created a repo on github manually
created a local directory, created the files, and opened it in VS Code
added some random content to the html and css files
commands used:
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/MuathAlrefai/basic_repo
git add .
git status //to make sure it worked
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push --set-upstream origin master //because I didnt make a branch so have to use this command to push to master branch
//made some changes to the files
git add .
git commit -m "some changes"
git push
