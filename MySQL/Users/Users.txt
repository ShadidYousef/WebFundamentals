1. we create a table from the MySQL workbench
2. we forward engineer it
3. we open cmd and login "mysql -u root -p ****
4. commands I used:
//select schema
use <database_name>;

//create 3 new users
insert into users (first_name, last_name, email, created_at, updated_at)
values ("Muath", "Alrefai", "muath@gmail.com", now(), now()), ("Kareem", "Taha", "kareem@gmail.com", now(), now()), ("Yazan", "Kayed", "yazan@gmail.com", now(), now());

//retrieve all from users
select * from users;

//retrieve first user using their email address
select email from users where id=1;

//Retrieve the last user using their id
select * from users order by id desc limit 1;

//Change the user with id=3 so their last name is Pancakes
update users set last_name = "Pancakes" where id=3;

//Delete the user with id=2 from the database
delete from users where id=2;

//Get all the users, sorted by their first name
select * from users order by first_name; 

//Get all the users, sorted by their first name in descending order
select * from users order by first_name desc;
